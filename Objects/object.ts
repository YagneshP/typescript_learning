/**
 *  Usage Checking
 */

// When providing value to location with object type meaning you assigned the variable with type(object) and the value using object literal (({...})), then all properties( declared in type) must be present in that value.

// here declaring the type object

type FirstNameAndLastName = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
};

// Here we are declaring variable 'hasBoth' and assigned type 'FirstNameAndLastName'
// and also assigning value at location, that means it must have properties 'fistName' and 'lastName'
// üìå try to uncomment one of the properties , typescript will throe error of missing property
const hasBoth: FirstNameAndLastName = {
  firstName: "Sarojini",
  lastName: "Naidu",

/**
 * Excess Property Check

// OK
let john: Student = {

// Here we are assigning the value at location with objec literal
let janny: Student = {

  // school_Name : "St.Xavier's"  // ‚ùå This is excess property
};

// Here we are assigning value with existing object 'studentWIthSchoolName' so typescript won't trigger the excess property check
